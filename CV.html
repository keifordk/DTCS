                <p>
                    I was studying Computer Science at Queen Mary University of London,
                    however due to my own personal reasons such as the location not being ideal,
                    and not enjoying being there I decided to leave on my own terms and try something new.
                    From my time there however, I learnt many valuable skills and gained a lot of useful knowledge,
                    such as learning various programming languages such as Python and JavaScript.

                    ⦁	Fluent speaker of both English and Japanese. (Can translate if necessary) <br />
                    ⦁	Accomplished communication skills, both written and verbal, developed 	through
                    numerous essays and presentations given during my time at sixth form and university. <br />
                    ⦁	Good people skills. <br />
                    ⦁	Advanced problem solving and numeracy skills. <br />
                    ⦁	Can work well alone or in groups, as I have done so many times in the past at my time during school, sixth form and university. <br />
                    ⦁	I am a very fast learner when it comes to being put in a work space that I haven’t got much expertise in,
                    and this comes from working a variety of jobs (listed below). <br />

                <p>
                    ⦁ 	I enjoy programming and tech in general, as I think it is a very interesting and broad topic,
                    that has yet to be explored to even close to its full potential, and the idea of what can be done in the future is very exciting.<br />
                    ⦁	I like to help people out, in whatever topic and place that might be,
                    as I know that helping others can also be a learning experience for myself as well. <br />
                    ⦁   In my spare time I like to play a variety of video games from MOBAs to FPSs to RPGs and MMOs, I enjoy video games of all genres.

                    ⦁	Children bring in work to be done and marked by us, and help/give feedback where necessary. <br />

                </p>

                <h3>Tesco Customer Assistant, London (2019 - 2020)</h3>

                <p>
                    ⦁	I have been working as a Customer Assistant at my local Tesco as a part time job
                    to earn some money on the side and learn some very valuable skills. <br />
                    ⦁	From working here, I have learnt how to help and assist customers
                    in a friendly and approachable manner, while still maintaining a high level of work. <br />
                    ⦁	I have also learnt how to deal with many kinds of customers, whether they are
                    friendly or arrogant. I think it is very important to make sure that you keep a
                    smile on your face even if the customers are rude or being impatient. <br />
                    ⦁	Another important skill that I have picked up from working at Tesco is time management,
                    as you must get to work on time, do certain tasks before a set deadline, and make sure
                    everything that needs to be done is done before you clock out at the end of your shift. <br />
                    •	Listening to and learning from your higher ups, such as the manager and/or shift leader
                    is a very important skill to have as it shows your willingness to learn and
                    adapt to new environments that you may not have been familiar with before. <br />
