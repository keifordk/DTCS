			<h3>Board / Card game</h3>

			<p>
				For the Games Design Principles module my group and I are creating a Board / Card game hybrid where <br />
				you go around a board trying to beat other players to the end of the board while also partaking in combat vs the <br />
				other players. There are also going to be portals on the board to add a variety of travel options for players to take. <br />
				Below is a prototype of the board we are going to be using in our final design, along with a (familiar looking) card which <br />
				will be used for the combat aspect of the game.
